                Introducing ++, a female-fronted doom-gaze band from Chicago, formed in 2022. 
                The group features Abigail Miller (bass and vocals), Dove Hollis (guitar), Ethan Loafman (drums), 
                and Hunter Gleber (synth). The ++ sonic palette is a fusion of doom metal, post-punk, and shoegaze, 
                a unique blend that sets them apart in the musical landscape. 
            </p>

                At the core of ++ is Abigail Miller, whose gripping bass lines and heart-wrenching vocals serve as 
                the emotional anchor of the band. Paired with Dove Hollis' low fuzzy guitars, Ethan Loafman's 
                thunderous drumming, and Hunter Gleber's ethereal OP-1 synth textures, the collective energy of ++ 
                delivers a visceral punch that leaves listeners immersed in a realm of intensely beautiful melancholy.
